    <h2>5. Organisation Structure – Meaning</h2>

<p>
Organisation structure refers to the formal framework within which tasks are divided, coordinated, and supervised in an organisation. 
It defines how roles, responsibilities, authority, and communication flow are arranged to achieve business goals effectively. 
It is the “skeleton” of the organisation that determines how work is managed and how people interact.
</p>

<h3><b>10-Marks Explanation (Pointers)</b></h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>Defines Formal Relationships:</b>
    It specifies who reports to whom, how responsibilities are distributed, and how authority is shared.
  </li>

  <li><b>Establishes Hierarchy:</b>
    Organisation structure creates levels of management — top, middle, and lower — and assigns clear positions and power.
  </li>

  <li><b>Clarifies Roles & Responsibilities:</b>
    It ensures every employee understands their duties, expectations, and assigned tasks, reducing confusion and conflicts.
  </li>

  <li><b>Ensures Smooth Communication:</b>
    Structure guides the flow of information — upward, downward, and horizontal — improving coordination between departments.
  </li>

  <li><b>Improves Efficiency:</b>
    A well-designed structure eliminates duplication of work, improves workflow, and increases operational efficiency.
  </li>

  <li><b>Supports Specialization:</b>
    By dividing tasks into departments (like marketing, finance, HR), employees can focus on specialised areas of work.
  </li>

  <li><b>Facilitates Decision-Making:</b>
    Clear authority levels help in faster and accurate decisions, improving overall organisational performance.
  </li>

</ol>

    <h2>6. Elements of Organisation Structure</h2>

<p>
Elements of organisation structure are the fundamental components that define how an organisation is designed, how responsibilities are assigned, 
and how coordination and control occur. These elements determine how effectively an organisation operates and achieves its goals.
</p>

<h3><b>10-Marks Explanation (Pointers)</b></h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>Work Specialization (Division of Labour):</b>
    Tasks are divided into smaller jobs and assigned to individuals based on skills. 
    It increases efficiency, expertise, and productivity by allowing employees to focus on specific tasks.
  </li>

  <li><b>Departmentalization:</b>
    Grouping of jobs and activities into departments such as Marketing, Finance, HR, Production, and IT. 
    It helps coordinate people and activities within functional units.
  </li>

  <li><b>Chain of Command:</b>
    The formal line of authority that flows from top management to lower-level employees. 
    It clarifies “who reports to whom” and ensures proper control and discipline.
  </li>

  <li><b>Span of Control:</b>
    Refers to the number of employees a manager can effectively supervise. 
    A wide span means more people under one manager, while a narrow span means fewer employees.
  </li>

  <li><b>Centralization:</b>
    Decision-making authority is concentrated at the top level. 
    Top management controls policies, strategies, and critical functions.
  </li>

  <li><b>Decentralization:</b>
    Decision-making power is distributed across lower and middle levels. 
    It increases flexibility, faster decisions, and employee empowerment.
  </li>

  <li><b>Formalization:</b>
    The degree to which rules, procedures, instructions, and policies are written and strictly followed. 
    High formalization means more control; low formalization means more flexibility.
  </li>

  <li><b>Authority & Responsibility:</b>
    Authority is the right to give orders. Responsibility is the duty to complete tasks. 
    A balance between the two ensures efficiency in the organisation.
  </li>

  <li><b>Coordination:</b>
    Harmonizing activities, departments, and employees to achieve organisational goals. 
    It ensures teamwork and avoids duplication of efforts.
  </li>

  <li><b>Communication Flow:</b>
    Structure defines upward, downward, and horizontal communication within the organisation. 
    Clear communication reduces misunderstandings and improves performance.
  </li>
